This is the Git repo of the [Docker "Official Image"](https://github.com/docker-library/official-images#what-are-official-images) for [`ghost`](https://hub.docker.com/_/ghost/) (not to be confused with any official `ghost` image provided by `ghost` upstream). See [the Docker Hub page](https://hub.docker.com/_/ghost/) for the full readme on how to use this Docker image and for information regarding contributing and issues.

The [full image description on Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/_/ghost/) is generated/maintained over in [the docker-library/docs repository](https://github.com/docker-library/docs), specifically in [the `ghost` directory](https://github.com/docker-library/docs/tree/master/ghost).
