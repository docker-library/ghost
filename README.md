<br>

## What is this?

**What is Ghost?** ‚Äî Ghost is an open-source software that lets you create your website with a blog. See the [FAQ section](https://play-with-ghost.com/ghost-themes/faq/#what-is-ghost) for more details. This projects makes it running in Docker image.

<br>

## Docker image features :

- [x] multi-stage builds
- [x] `curl`* to support `healthchecks`
- [x] a better `config.production.json` template
- [x] Docker image based on alpine (we don't maintain debian)
- [x] Labels based on the opencontainer standard

We are trimming about 45MB. These are **uncompressed sizes** :

```
devmtl/ghostfire:stable                340MB
ghost:4.16.0-alpine                    384MB
```

<br>

## Github Actions CI/CD :

[![ci status](https://github.com/firepress-org/ghostfire/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://github.com/firepress-org/ghostfire/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

- [x] Extreme visibility in the Graph.
- [x] Support multi architecture platforms: `linux/amd64`, `linux/arm64`, `linux/arm/v7`
- [x] Great logic between jobs
- [x] Shared variables between jobs
- [x] Builds use cache
- [x] Continuous Deployment in the cluster for edge and stable
- [x] Slack notifications when a build is successful
- [x] Lighthouse audit(localhost and online)
- [x] Security scanners (Snyk, Trivy, Dockle)
- [x] super-linter
- [x] Overall we do our best to apply [best practices](https://firepress.org/en/how-do-we-update-hundreds-of-ghosts-websites-on-docker-swarm/)

![CI_2021-10-03_17h42](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6694151/135772462-0c39fe73-be9e-4aa3-8103-b1c849c0c41f.jpg)

## Live Demo

Want to try Ghost quickly? This is for you!

[play-with-ghost.com](https://play-with-ghost.com/) is a playground to learn about Ghost. What's remarkable here, is that you have the option to log into the admin panel of each live demo available, by using dummy credentials.

In short, you can try Ghost on the spot without having to sign-up!

#### Continuous integration

See [Github Actions sections](https://github.com/firepress-org/ghostfire/actions)

At this point, this docker image has been pulled more than **11 millions of time**!

![docker-hub](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6694151/53067692-4c8af700-34a3-11e9-9fcf-9c7ad169a91b.jpg)

#### Option #1 (basic run)

```
GHOSTFIRE_IMG="devmtl/ghostfire:stable"

docker run -d \
‚Äîname ghostblog \
-p 2368:2368 \
-e url=http://localhost:2368 \
${GHOSTFIRE_IMG}
```

#### Option #2 (with configs and stateful data)

```
GHOSTFIRE_IMG="devmtl/ghostfire:stable"

docker run -d \
‚Äîname ghostblog \
-p 2368:2368 \
-e url=http://localhost:2368 \
-v /myuser/localpath/ghost/content:/var/lib/ghost/content \
-v /myuser/localpath/ghost/content/config.production.json:/var/lib/ghost/config.production.json \
${GHOSTFIRE_IMG}
```

To configure the `config.production.json` refer the [ghost docs](https://docs.ghost.org/concepts/config/).

#### master branch (stable) tags üê≥

For the **stable** branch, I recommend using the tag from the **first line**:

```
devmtl/ghostfire:stable_4.6.4_fc5b3b6_2021-05-28_11H26s02
devmtl/ghostfire:stable_4.6.4
devmtl/ghostfire:stable
```

Find the latest tags on **DockerHub** here:
[https://hub.docker.com/r/devmtl/ghostfire/tags/](https://hub.docker.com/r/devmtl/ghostfire/tags/)

#### edge branch (dev) tags üê≥

This is reserved for development and testing.

```
devmtl/ghostfire:edge_4.7.0_bd6bac4_2021-06-17_18H43s47
devmtl/ghostfire:edge_4.7.0
devmtl/ghostfire:edge
```

## DevOps best practices

Let's understand our processes. In this post ¬´ [How we update hundreds of Ghost's websites on Docker Swarm?](https://firepress.org/en/how-we-update-hundreds-of-ghosts-websites-on-docker-swarm/) ¬ª, we explain how we deploy Ghost in production and which best practices we do follow.

## Enhanced unit tests during the CI

![unit-test-a](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6694151/61649557-b80a0800-ac7f-11e9-85b7-425e5456cb2d.jpg)
<br>
![unit-test-b](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6694151/61649559-b80a0800-ac7f-11e9-9154-cd6f5264af71.jpg)
<br>
![unit-test-c](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6694151/61649558-b80a0800-ac7f-11e9-9638-4b3241e4dcee.jpg)

<br>

## Developing Ghost themes locally

I open-sourced [my setup here](https://github.com/firepress-org/ghost-local-dev-in-docker). It‚Äôs a workflow to run Ghost locally within a Docker container. Once your local paths are defined, it‚Äôs enjoyable and easy to work **between many themes**.

<br>

## Random stuff

**Breaking change**. If you still run Ghost 0.11.xx (not recommended!), be aware of the container's path difference.

```
- Ghost 4.x.x is:  /var/lib/ghost/content
- Ghost 3.x.x is:  /var/lib/ghost/content
- Ghost 2.x.x is:  /var/lib/ghost/content
- Ghost 1.x.x is:  /var/lib/ghost/content
- Ghost 0.11.x is: /var/lib/ghost
```

**SQLite Database**

This Docker image for Ghost uses SQLite. There is nothing special to configure.

**What is the Node.js version?**

We follow the latest Node supported version. See this in the Dockerfile.

```
docker exec <container-id> node --version
```

You can also see this information in the CI logs.

<br>

## FirePress Hosting

At FirePress we empower entrepreneurs and small organizations to create their websites on top of [Ghost](https://firepress.org/en/faq/#what-is-ghost).

At the moment, our **pricing** for hosting one Ghost website is $15 (Canadian dollars). This price will be only available for our first 100 new clients, starting May 1st, 2019 üôå. [See our pricing section](https://firepress.org/en/pricing/) for details.

More details [about this announcement](https://forum.ghost.org/t/host-your-ghost-website-on-firepress/7092/1) on Ghost's forum.
