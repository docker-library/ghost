## About Ghost our favorite CMS

[Ghost](https://ghost.org/) is a free and open source website & blogging platform designed to simplify the process of publishing. It‚Äôs individual bloggers as well as online publications. You can see Ghost as a CMS (content management system) designed to be better alternative to systems like: *WordPress, Drupal, Medium, Tumblr*, etc.


## How to use this image

**Option #1**:
- Locally, run the script: `./runup.sh`

**Option #2**:

```
GHOSTFIRE_IMG="devmtl/ghostfire:edge"

docker run -d \
‚Äîname ghostblog \
-p 2368:2368 \
-e url=http://localhost:2368 -e NODE_ENV=production \
"$GHOSTFIRE_IMG"
```

**Option #3 (Stateful)**

```
GHOSTFIRE_IMG="devmtl/ghostfire:edge"

docker run -d \
‚Äîname ghostblog \
-p 2368:2368 \
-e url=http://localhost:2368 -e NODE_ENV=production \
-v /myuser/local-dev-path/ghost/content:/var/lib/ghost/content \
"$GHOSTFIRE_IMG"
```

### Find the most recent docker image üê≥

Instead of using edge (*most people use latest but I prefer edge :-p*) use the **stable image**.

- **Docker hub** ‚Äî https://hub.docker.com/r/devmtl/ghostfire/tags/
- **Travis** ‚Äî https://travis-ci.org/firepress-org/ghostfire

I recommand to use the **stable tag**, where:
- `1.24.8-583cc3f-20180713_01H3604` is the **Ghost Version** PLUS the **SHA of the git commit** PLUS the date when the image was create.
- The logic is that I can use a **specific** image to test and push it in PROD as needed. In this example, using `devmtl/ghostfire:1.22.5` could turn out to be a broken docker image and is not best practice. 

As an example:

### edge branch tags are:

```
devmtl/ghostfire:1.24.8-edge-79fa76a
devmtl/ghostfire:edge
```

### master branch (stable) tags are:

```
devmtl/ghostfire:1.24.8-583cc3f-20180713_01H3604
devmtl/ghostfire:1.24.8-583cc3f
devmtl/ghostfire:1.22.8
devmtl/ghostfire:20180713_01H3604
```

### Branches: edge vs master

Because I run a lot of websites in production using this image, I prefer to do my tests using a dedicated `edge` branch.

Once I confirm the edge build PASS, I update the Dockerfile under the `master` branch as well. At this point, I‚Äôm really confident the docker image is working perfectly.

## Various info

**Breaking change**

If you want to run Ghost 0.11.xx, be aware of the container's path difference:

Ghost 1.x.x is: /var/lib/ghost/content
Ghost 0.11.x is: /var/lib/ghost

**SQLite Database**

This Docker image for Ghost uses SQLite. There is nothing special to configure.

**What is the Node.js version?**

```
docker exec <container-id> node --version
```

You can also see this information in the Dockerfile and in the Travis builds.


## Developper setup

[I open sourced](https://github.com/firepress-org/ghost-local-dev-in-docker) the local setup. This is a workflow to run Ghost locally within a docker container. It allows you to easily develop Ghost themes and/or Ghost itself.


## Why forking the offical Dockerfile ?

I tweaked elements like:

- Ghost container is running under [tini](https://github.com/krallin/tini)
- Using `node:8.11.3-alpine` instead of Node:6
- Better ENV var management
- Uninstall the `ghost cli` to safe few bytes in the docker image

## Author

In the world of OSS (open source software) most people refer themselves as maintainers. The thing is‚Ä¶ I hate this expression. It feels heavy and not fun. I much prefer author.
