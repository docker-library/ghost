# ghostfire


## What is this?

It‚Äôs a Docker image to run Ghost V2 in a container. Fully compatible with a simple `docker run`, Kubernetes or Docker Swarm.

**What is Ghost?** ‚Äî Ghost is an open source software that lets you create your website with a blog. See the [FAQ section](https://play-with-ghost.com/ghost-themes/faq/#what-is-ghost) for more details.

Source: https://github.com/firepress-org/ghostfire


## Live Demo

Want to try Ghost quickly? This is for you!

[play-with-ghost.com](https://play-with-ghost.com/) is a playground to learn about Ghost. What's remarkable here, is that you have the option to log into the admin panel of each live demo available, by using dummy credentials.

In short, you can try Ghost on the spot without having to sign-up!

## Why forking the official Docker image?

We tweaked a few elements like:

1. Ghost container is running under [tini](https://github.com/krallin/tini#why-tini)
2. Easier to read Dockerfile with a cleaner ARG display
3. Uninstall the `ghost cli` to save some space in the final docker image
4. clean node cache
5. Added `curl` to do healthchecks

In the future, we plan to use a **multi-stage** build to slim down the image when Docker EE will supports it officially.


## How to use this image

**Requirement**: Ensure you have Docker installed on your machine. ([MAC OS X](https://hub.docker.com/editions/community/docker-ce-desktop-mac))

To run Ghost in a Docker container, here is the setup we are using in production. Just execute `runup.sh` bash script and you are good to go.

**Option #1 (Stateful)**

‚ö†Ô∏è warning ‚Äî change the path `/myuser/localpath/ghost/content` and use the latest stable docker image.

```
GHOSTFIRE_IMG="devmtl/ghostfire:stable"

docker run -d \
‚Äîname ghostblog \
-p 2368:2368 \
-e url=http://localhost:2368 -e NODE_ENV=production \
-v /myuser/localpath/ghost/content:/var/lib/ghost/content \
${GHOSTFIRE_IMG}
```

**Option #2**:

```
GHOSTFIRE_IMG="devmtl/ghostfire:stable"

docker run -d \
‚Äîname ghostblog \
-p 2368:2368 \
-e url=http://localhost:2368 -e NODE_ENV=production \
${GHOSTFIRE_IMG}
```

**Option #3**:

- Run the script by typing: `./runup.sh`

#### Find the latest docker images tag üê≥

- **Docker hub** ‚Äî https://hub.docker.com/r/devmtl/ghostfire/tags/
- **Travis** ‚Äî https://travis-ci.org/firepress-org/ghostfire

I'm surprised that at this point, it's been pulled more than **11 millions of time**!

![docker-hub](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6694151/53067692-4c8af700-34a3-11e9-9fcf-9c7ad169a91b.jpg)


#### master branch (stable) tags üê≥

I recommend using the tag from this format: $IMAGE_SHA_SHORT:

```
devmtl/ghostfire:2.9.1-99814a4
```

But if you prefer, you can use:

```
devmtl/ghostfire:2.9.1
devmtl/ghostfire:stable
```


#### edge branch (not stable) tags üê≥

```
devmtl/ghostfire:edge-2.9.1-7d64db0
devmtl/ghostfire:edge-2.9.1
devmtl/ghostfire:edge
```


### Edge VS Master

‚ö†Ô∏è Workflow warning. You would expect that we would merge `edge` into `master`. We don‚Äôt do this. Instead, think of it as independent projects. The main reason is because the **.travis.yml is not the same in those two branches**.

Let‚Äôs understand our process.

Because we run a lot of websites in production using this image, we prefer to do my UAT (tests) using a dedicated `edge` branch. **In other words, it‚Äôs a manual checkpoint to avoid a crash at scale.**

It also has the advantage of keeping a clean commit history in the master branch (without doing git-fu all the time).

Once we confirm the edge build is a PASS, we update the Dockerfile in `master` branch as well. At this point, we are entirely confident the docker image is working correctly.


#### Well tested

DevOps best practices are essential to us. Many checkpoints ensure this Docker image for Ghost software runs smoothly.

[In this post](https://firepress.org/en/software-and-ghost-updates/), we explain how we deploy Ghost in production and which best practices we do follow.


## Developing Ghost themes locally

I open sourced [my setup here](https://github.com/firepress-org/ghost-local-dev-in-docker). It‚Äôs a workflow to run Ghost locally within a Docker container. Once your local paths are defined, it‚Äôs enjoyable and easy to work **between many themes**.


## Random stuff

**Breaking change**. If you still run Ghost 0.11.xx, be aware of the container's path difference.

```
- Ghost 2.x.x is: /var/lib/ghost/content
- Ghost 1.x.x is: /var/lib/ghost/content
- Ghost 0.11.x is: /var/lib/ghost
```

**SQLite Database**

This Docker image for Ghost uses SQLite. There is nothing special to configure.

**What is the Node.js version?**

We follow the latest Node supported version. See this in the Dockerfile.

```
docker exec <container-id> node --version
```

You can also see this information in the Dockerfile and in the Travis builds.
