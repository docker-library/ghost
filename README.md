# [ghostfire](https://github.com/firepress-org/ghostfire)

<br>

## What is this?

**Docker image** ‚Äî This is a Docker image to run Ghost V3 in a container üê≥. Fully compatible with a simple `docker run`, Docker Swarm or Kubernetes. Ensure you have Docker installed on your machine.

**What is Ghost?** ‚Äî Ghost is an open source software that lets you create your website with a blog. See the [FAQ section](https://play-with-ghost.com/ghost-themes/faq/#what-is-ghost) for more details.

<br>

## Why forking the official Docker image?

- [x] Use a complexe but easy to follow **multi-stage build**. This docker image is much smaller. See details below.
- [x] Use a `node-core` layer in order to **not include** npm, yarn, npx and friends in the final docker image
- [x] **Compress** `node` using `upx`
- [x] Use [**tini**](https://github.com/krallin/tini#why-tini)
- [x] Use a better `config.production.json` **template**. These override the [default one](https://github.com/TryGhost/Ghost/blob/0faf89b5abcf6de747d4b309cdac364a863c71dc/core/server/config/defaults.json#L82)
- [x] Have `curl` in the final image to support **`healthchecks`**
- [x] Enhanced **unit tests with scanners** (Aqua Security, Trivy) in the CI
- [x] Using **LABELS** based on the opencontainer standard
- [x] Uninstall the `ghost cli` to save some space in the final docker image
- [x] Use `npm cache clean --force` to safe some space
- [x] The Docker image is **multi-arch ready**: `AMD64`, `ARM64`, `ARM` (wip)
- [x] Feature requests are [tracked in our issues](https://github.com/firepress-org/ghostfire/labels/feature%20request)

Overall, I do my best to apply **best practices**. Please let me know if something can be improved :)


#### Comparing docker image sizes

We were able to trim about `100MB` on this image!

```
devmtl/ghostfire:stable_3.38.3         270MB (89MB)

ghost:3.38.3-alpine                    374MB (110MB)

ghost:3.38.3                           440MB (132MB)
```

## Live Demo

Want to try Ghost quickly? This is for you!

[play-with-ghost.com](https://play-with-ghost.com/) is a playground to learn about Ghost. What's remarkable here, is that you have the option to log into the admin panel of each live demo available, by using dummy credentials.

In short, you can try Ghost on the spot without having to sign-up!

## How to use this docker image?

First, find the latest docker images tags üê≥.

#### Docker hub
Find the latest tags here: 
[https://hub.docker.com/r/devmtl/ghostfire/tags/](https://hub.docker.com/r/devmtl/ghostfire/tags/)

#### Continuous integration
See[Github Actions sections](https://github.com/firepress-org/ghostfire/actions)

At this point, this docker image has been pulled more than **11 millions of time**!

![docker-hub](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6694151/53067692-4c8af700-34a3-11e9-9fcf-9c7ad169a91b.jpg)

#### Option #1 (let the script work for you):

- Run this script by typing: `./runup.sh`

#### Option #2:

```
GHOSTFIRE_IMG="devmtl/ghostfire:stable"

docker run -d \
‚Äîname ghostblog \
-p 2368:2368 \
-e url=http://localhost:2368 \
${GHOSTFIRE_IMG}
```

#### Option #3 (Stateful with configs):

```
GHOSTFIRE_IMG="devmtl/ghostfire:stable"

docker run -d \
‚Äîname ghostblog \
-p 2368:2368 \
-e url=http://localhost:2368 \
-v /myuser/localpath/ghost/content:/var/lib/ghost/content \
-v /myuser/localpath/ghost/content:/var/lib/ghost/config.production.json \
${GHOSTFIRE_IMG}
```

To configure the `config.production.json` refer the [ghost docs](https://docs.ghost.org/concepts/config/).

#### master branch (stable) tags üê≥

For the **stable** branch, I recommend using the tag from the **first line**:

```
devmtl/ghostfire:stable_3.38.3_24b6bdf_2020-11-30_04H07s53
devmtl/ghostfire:stable_3.38.3
devmtl/ghostfire:stable
```

#### edge branch (dev) tags üê≥

For the **edge** branch (for dev), I recommend using the tag from the **last line**:

```
devmtl/ghostfire:edge_3.38.3_613c210_2020-11-30_23H41s10
devmtl/ghostfire:edge_3.38.3
devmtl/ghostfire:edge
```

## DevOps best practices

Let's understand our processes.In this post ¬´ [How we update hundreds of Ghost's websites on Docker Swarm?](https://firepress.org/en/how-we-update-hundreds-of-ghosts-websites-on-docker-swarm/) ¬ª, we explain how we deploy Ghost in production and which best practices we do follow.

## Enhanced unit tests during the CI

![unit-test-a](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6694151/61649557-b80a0800-ac7f-11e9-85b7-425e5456cb2d.jpg)
<br>
![unit-test-b](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6694151/61649559-b80a0800-ac7f-11e9-9154-cd6f5264af71.jpg)
<br>
![unit-test-c](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6694151/61649558-b80a0800-ac7f-11e9-9638-4b3241e4dcee.jpg)

<br>

## Developing Ghost themes locally

I open sourced [my setup here](https://github.com/firepress-org/ghost-local-dev-in-docker). It‚Äôs a workflow to run Ghost locally within a Docker container. Once your local paths are defined, it‚Äôs enjoyable and easy to work **between many themes**.

<br>

## Random stuff

**Breaking change**. If you still run Ghost 0.11.xx (not recommanded!), be aware of the container's path difference.

```
- Ghost 3.x.x is:  /var/lib/ghost/content
- Ghost 2.x.x is:  /var/lib/ghost/content
- Ghost 1.x.x is:  /var/lib/ghost/content
- Ghost 0.11.x is: /var/lib/ghost
```

**SQLite Database**

This Docker image for Ghost uses SQLite. There is nothing special to configure.

**What is the Node.js version?**

We follow the latest Node supported version. See this in the Dockerfile.

```
docker exec <container-id> node --version
```

You can also see this information in the CI logs.

<br>

## FirePress Hosting

At FirePress we empower entrepreneurs and small organizations to create their websites on top of [Ghost](https://firepress.org/en/faq/#what-is-ghost).

At the moment, our **pricing** for hosting one Ghost website is $15 (Canadian dollars). This price will be only available for our first 100 new clients, starting May 1st, 2019 üôå. [See our pricing section](https://firepress.org/en/pricing/) for details.
