## What is this

It‚Äôs a Docker image for running Ghost in a container.


## About Ghost our favorite CMS

[Ghost](https://ghost.org/) is a free and open source website & blogging platform designed to simplify the process of publishing. It‚Äôs for individual bloggers as well as online publications. You can see Ghost as a CMS (content management system) designed as an alternative to systems like *Medium, WordPress, Squarespace, Wix, Tumblr, Drupal, Zoola*, etc.

On the other side, the idea behind **FirePress** is to empower freelancers and small organizations to be able to build an outstanding mobile-first website. **We exclusively host Ghost websites**.

Because we believe your website should speak up in your name, we consider our mission completed once your site has become [your impresario](https://play-with-ghost.com/ghost-themes/why-launching-your-next-website-with-firepress/).


##  Live Demo

Head over to the [Live Demo](https://play-with-ghost.com/ghost-themes/playground/) section, and see what Ghost can do for you. Thanks to `play-with-ghost.com` you can even login directly into the **admin panel** by using the available credentials. You can also see and try many Ghost **Themes**.

We you can try **Ghost version 2** here:<br>

## How to use this image

To run Ghost in a Docker container, here is the setup I use in production. Just execute `runup.sh` bash script and you are good to go. This setup also allows you to run your blog under a subdirectory like `mysite.com/blog`.

Ensure you have Docker installed on your server. To update your Ghost container, just stop the container and execute to runup.sh again.

**Option #1**:
- Run the script: `./runup.sh`

**Option #2**:

```
GHOSTFIRE_IMG="devmtl/ghostfire:1.24.8-583cc3f"

docker run -d \
‚Äîname ghostblog \
-p 2368:2368 \
-e url=http://localhost:2368 -e NODE_ENV=production \
"$GHOSTFIRE_IMG"
```

**Option #3 (Stateful)**

Don‚Äôt forget to change the path on your local drive!

```
GHOSTFIRE_IMG="devmtl/ghostfire:1.24.8-583cc3f"

docker run -d \
‚Äîname ghostblog \
-p 2368:2368 \
-e url=http://localhost:2368 -e NODE_ENV=production \
-v /myuser/local-dev-path/ghost/content:/var/lib/ghost/content \
"$GHOSTFIRE_IMG"
```

### Find the most recent docker image üê≥

Instead of using edge (*most people use latest but I prefer edge :-p*) use the **stable image**.

- **Docker hub** ‚Äî https://hub.docker.com/r/devmtl/ghostfire/tags/
- **Travis** ‚Äî https://travis-ci.org/firepress-org/ghostfire

As an example:

### master branch (stable) tags looks like:

```
devmtl/ghostfire:1.24.8-583cc3f-20180713_01H3604
devmtl/ghostfire:1.24.8-583cc3f
devmtl/ghostfire:1.22.8
devmtl/ghostfire:20180713_01H3604
```

I recommend to use the **stable tag**, where:
- `1.24.8-583cc3f-20180713_01H3604` is the Ghost **version** + the **SHA** of the git commit + the **date**.
- The logic is that I can use a **specific** image to test and push it in PROD as needed. In this example, only using `devmtl/ghostfire:1.24.8` could turn out to be a broken docker image and is not the best practice. 


### edge branch tags looks like:

```
devmtl/ghostfire:1.24.8-edge-79fa76a
devmtl/ghostfire:edge
```


### Branches: edge vs. master

Because I run a lot of websites in production using this image, I prefer to do my tests using a dedicated `edge` branch.

Once I confirm the edge build PASS, I update the Dockerfile under the `master` branch as well. At this point, I‚Äôm reaaaaaally confident the docker image is working correctly.

## Developer setup

[I open sourced here](https://github.com/firepress-org/ghost-local-dev-in-docker). It‚Äôs a workflow to run Ghost locally within a Docker container. Once your local paths are define it‚Äôs really fun and easy to work between many themes.


## Various

**Breaking change**


- Ghost 2.x.x is: /var/lib/ghost/content
- Ghost 1.x.x is: /var/lib/ghost/content
- Ghost 0.11.x is: /var/lib/ghost

*If you still run Ghost 0.11.xx, be aware of the container's path difference.*

**SQLite Database**

This Docker image for Ghost uses SQLite. There is nothing special to configure.

**What is the Node.js version?**

```
docker exec <container-id> node --version
```

You can also see this information in the Dockerfile and in the Travis builds.


## Why forking the official Dockerfile?

I tweaked few elements like:

- Ghost container is running under [tini](https://github.com/krallin/tini#why-tini)
- A cleaner ENV VAR management
- Uninstall the `ghost cli` to safe few bytes in the docker image
- In the future, the image will support multi-stage build
