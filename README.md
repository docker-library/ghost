# ghostfire

## What is this?

**Docker stuff** ‚Äî It‚Äôs a Docker image to run Ghost (V2) in a container üê≥. Fully compatible with a simple `docker run`, Kubernetes or Docker Swarm. Ensure you have Docker installed on your machine.

**What is Ghost?** ‚Äî Ghost is an open source software that lets you create your website with a blog. See the [FAQ section](https://play-with-ghost.com/ghost-themes/faq/#what-is-ghost) for more details.

**Git repo** ‚Äî [https://github.com/firepress-org/ghostfire](https://github.com/firepress-org/ghostfire)

<br>

## Why forking the official Docker image?

- [x] Using multi-stage builds. This docker image is much smaller. See details below.
- [x] Using a `node-core` layer in order to not include npm, yarn, npx in the final docker image
- [x] Compress `node` using `upx`
- [x] Ghost container is running under [tini](https://github.com/krallin/tini#why-tini)
- [x] Using a better `config.production.json` template
- [x] Uninstall the `ghost cli` to save some space in the final docker image
- [x] Using `npm cache clean --force` to safe some space
- [x] Adding `curl` to do healthchecks
- [x] Enhanced unit tests (Aqua Security, Trivy)
- [x] Using LABELS based on the opencontainer standard
- [x] The Docker image is multi-architecture: `AMD64`, `ARM64`, `ARM`

**Overall, I try my best to apply best practices**. Please let me know if something can be improved :)

 Ideas for features are tracked under [this label](https://github.com/firepress-org/ghostfire/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22feature+request%22).

#### Comparing docker image sizes

```
multi-stage / using my node-core
devmtl/ghostfire:2.23.4-77c5e56                 201 MB (74 MO)

multi-stage / simply using node_10.16-alpine
devmtl/ghostfire:2.23.3-bf541c7                 246 MB (79 MO)

single-stage docker official
ghost:alpine  / simply using node_10.16-alpine  284MB (123 MB)
```

## Live Demo

Want to try Ghost quickly? This is for you!

[play-with-ghost.com](https://play-with-ghost.com/) is a playground to learn about Ghost. What's remarkable here, is that you have the option to log into the admin panel of each live demo available, by using dummy credentials.

In short, you can try Ghost on the spot without having to sign-up!

## How to use this docker image?

First, find the latest docker images tags üê≥

- **Docker hub** ‚Äî https://hub.docker.com/r/devmtl/ghostfire/tags/
- **Travis** ‚Äî https://travis-ci.org/firepress-org/ghostfire

At this point, this docker image has been pulled more than **11 millions of time**!

![docker-hub](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6694151/53067692-4c8af700-34a3-11e9-9fcf-9c7ad169a91b.jpg)

#### Option #1 (Stateful):

‚ö†Ô∏è warning ‚Äî change path `/myuser/localpath/ghost/content` and use the latest stable docker image.

```
GHOSTFIRE_IMG="devmtl/ghostfire:2.23.4-77c5e56"

docker run -d \
‚Äîname ghostblog \
-p 2368:2368 \
-e url=http://localhost:2368 \
-v /myuser/localpath/ghost/content:/var/lib/ghost/content \
-v /myuser/localpath/ghost/content:/var/lib/ghost/config.production.json \
${GHOSTFIRE_IMG}
```

To configure the `config.production.json` refer the [ghost docs](https://docs.ghost.org/concepts/config/).

#### Option #2:

```
GHOSTFIRE_IMG="devmtl/ghostfire:2.23.4-77c5e56"

docker run -d \
‚Äîname ghostblog \
-p 2368:2368 \
-e url=http://localhost:2368 \
${GHOSTFIRE_IMG}
```

#### Option #3 (simple rundry):

- Run the script by typing: `./runup.sh`

#### master branch (stable) tags üê≥

I recommend using the tag in this format: $IMAGE_SHA_SHORT:

```
devmtl/ghostfire:2.23.4-77c5e56
```

But if you prefer, you can use:

```
devmtl/ghostfire:2.23.4
or ‚Ä¶
devmtl/ghostfire:stable
```


For the **edge** branch (for dev) tags üê≥

```
devmtl/ghostfire:edge-2.9.1-7d64db0
devmtl/ghostfire:edge-2.9.1
devmtl/ghostfire:edge
```


#### Master VS Edge

‚ö†Ô∏è Workflow warning. You would expect that we would merge `edge` into `master`. We don‚Äôt do this. Instead, think of it as independent projects. The main reason is that the **.travis.yml is not the same in those two branches**.

Let's understand our processes.

<br>

## DevOps best practices

Because we run a lot of websites in production using this image, we prefer to do UAT (unit acceptance tests) using the `edge` branch. **In other words, it‚Äôs a manual checkpoint to avoid a crash at scale.** DevOps best practices are essential to us. Many checkpoints ensure this Docker image for Ghost software runs smoothly.

It also has the advantage of keeping a clean commit history in the master branch (without doing git-fu all the time).

In this post ¬´ [How we update hundreds of Ghost's websites on Docker Swarm?](https://firepress.org/en/how-we-update-hundreds-of-ghosts-websites-on-docker-swarm/) ¬ª, we explain how we deploy Ghost in production and which best practices we do follow.

Because we use scanners, the build time went from about 4 min to 9 min.

<br>

## Developing Ghost themes locally

I open sourced [my setup here](https://github.com/firepress-org/ghost-local-dev-in-docker). It‚Äôs a workflow to run Ghost locally within a Docker container. Once your local paths are defined, it‚Äôs enjoyable and easy to work **between many themes**.

<br>

## Random stuff

**Breaking change**. If you still run Ghost 0.11.xx (not recommanded!), be aware of the container's path difference.

```
- Ghost 2.x.x is: /var/lib/ghost/content
- Ghost 1.x.x is: /var/lib/ghost/content
- Ghost 0.11.x is: /var/lib/ghost
```

**SQLite Database**

This Docker image for Ghost uses SQLite. There is nothing special to configure.

**What is the Node.js version?**

We follow the latest Node supported version. See this in the Dockerfile.

```
docker exec <container-id> node --version
```

You can also see this information in the Travis CI logs.

## FirePress Hosting

At FirePress we empower entrepreneurs and small organizations to create their websites on top of [Ghost](https://firepress.org/en/faq/#what-is-ghost).

At the moment, our **pricing** for hosting one Ghost website is $15 (Canadian dollars). This price will be only available for our first 100 new clients, starting May 1st, 2019 üôå. [See our pricing section](https://firepress.org/en/pricing/) for details.

More details [about this annoucement](https://forum.ghost.org/t/host-your-ghost-website-on-firepress/7092/1) on Ghost's forum.
