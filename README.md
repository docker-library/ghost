## Why forking the offical Dockerfile ?

The elements I tweaked are:

- I want Ghost container to run under [tini](https://github.com/krallin/tini)
- Using node:8.11.1-alpine instead of Node:6
- Cleaner ENV management
- Uninstall during build `ghost cli` to safe few bytes in the docker image
- Use of `$SUB_VERSION` var for a better tagging of the docker image artifacts


## Run ghost with docker

**Option #1**:
- Run the script: `./runup.sh`

**Option #2**:

```
docker run -d \
‚Äîname ghostblog \
-p 2368:2368 \
-e url=http://localhost:2368 -e NODE_ENV=production \
devmtl/ghostfire:1.22.4D-9ebb479
```

Make sure to find the most recent docker image build. For the **statefull version**, see the section *Developper setup*.


## Finding what is the most recewnt docker image üê≥

- **Docker hub** ‚Äî https://hub.docker.com/r/devmtl/ghostfire/tags/
- **Travis** ‚Äî https://travis-ci.org/firepress-org/ghostfire

My builds produce many tags:

```
# THIS IS AN EXAMPLE
  
devmtl/ghostfire:1.22.4D-9ebb479
devmtl/ghostfire:1.22.4D
devmtl/ghostfire:edge
devmtl/ghostfire:9ebb4798cd6f18ae8b6eb90313ad00a002a9a8e9
devmtl/ghostfire:2018-04-30_03-13-05
```

I recommand to use the first format, where:
- `1.22.4` is the Ghost Version
- `D` is the sub version
- `9ebb479` is the git commit used to do the build

The logic is that I can test a **specific** image in UAT and push it in PROD as needed. In this example, using `devmtl/ghostfire:1.22.4D` could turn out to be a broekn docker image.  


## Developper setup

- Soon, I will share the setup I use on my Mac to develop Ghost Themes and test Ghost in general.


## Base image

- [node:8.11.1-alpine](https://registry.hub.docker.com/_/node/)

## Author

In the world of OSS (open source software) most people refer themselves as maintainers. The thing is I hate this expression. It feels heavy and not fun. I much prefer author.
