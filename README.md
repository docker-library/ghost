# ghostfire


## What is this?

It’s a Docker image to run Ghost V2 in a container. Fully compatible with a simple `docker run`, Kubernetes or Docker Swarm.

**What is Ghost?** — Ghost is an open source software that lets you create your website with a blog. See the [FAQ section](https://play-with-ghost.com/ghost-themes/faq/#what-is-ghost) for more details.

Source: https://github.com/firepress-org/ghostfire


## Live Demo

Want to try Ghost quickly? This is for you!

[play-with-ghost.com](https://play-with-ghost.com/) is a playground to learn about Ghost. What's remarkable here, is that you have the option to log in into the admin panel of each live demo available, by using dummy credentials.

In short, you can try Ghost on the spot without having to sign-up!

## Why forking the official Docker image?

We tweaked a few elements like:

- Ghost container is running under [tini](https://github.com/krallin/tini#why-tini)
- Easier to read Dockerfile with a cleaner envvar display
- Uninstall the `ghost cli` to save some space in the final docker image
- Added `curl` to do healthcheck

In the future, we plan to use a multi-stage build to slim down the image


## How to use this image

**Requirement**: Ensure you have Docker installed on your machine. ([MAC OS X](https://hub.docker.com/editions/community/docker-ce-desktop-mac))

To run Ghost in a Docker container, here is the setup we use in production. Just execute `runup.sh` bash script and you are good to go.

**Option #1 (Stateful)**

⚠️ warning — change the path `/myuser/localpath/ghost/content` and use the latest stable docker image.

```
GHOSTFIRE_IMG="devmtl/ghostfire:stable"

docker run -d \
—name ghostblog \
-p 2368:2368 \
-e url=http://localhost:2368 -e NODE_ENV=production \
-v /myuser/localpath/ghost/content:/var/lib/ghost/content \
${GHOSTFIRE_IMG}
```

**Option #2**:

```
GHOSTFIRE_IMG="devmtl/ghostfire:stable"

docker run -d \
—name ghostblog \
-p 2368:2368 \
-e url=http://localhost:2368 -e NODE_ENV=production \
${GHOSTFIRE_IMG}
```

**Option #3**:

- Run the script by typing: `./runup.sh`

#### Find the latest docker images tag 🐳

- **Docker hub** — https://hub.docker.com/r/devmtl/ghostfire/tags/
- **Travis** — https://travis-ci.org/firepress-org/ghostfire

I'm surprised that at this point, it's been downloaded more than **5 millions of time**!

![docker-hub](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6694151/53067692-4c8af700-34a3-11e9-9fcf-9c7ad169a91b.jpg)


#### master branch (stable) tags 🐳

I recommend using the tag from this format: $IMAGE_SHA_SHORT

```
devmtl/ghostfire:2.9.1-99814a4
devmtl/ghostfire:2.9.1
devmtl/ghostfire:stable
```


#### edge branch (not stable) tags 🐳

```
devmtl/ghostfire:edge-2.9.1-7d64db0
devmtl/ghostfire:edge-2.9.1
devmtl/ghostfire:edge
```


#### Git Branches: Edge VS Master

⚠️ Workflow warning. You would expect that we merge `edge` into `master`. We DON'T do this. Think of it as two independent projects. The main reason for this is the fact that **the two .travis.yml files don’t push the same docker images** (stable VS edge).

Let’s understand our process.

Because we run a lot of websites in production using this image, we prefer to do UAT (tests) using a dedicated `edge` branch. Few sites (a cohort of all site we manage) deploy automatically every update on edge. **It’s a manual checkpoint that helps us avoiding crashing websites at scale**. It also has the advantage to keep a clean commit history (without doing git-fu all the time).

Once we confirm the edge build is a PASS, we update the Dockerfile in `master` branch as well. At this point, we are entirely confident the docker image is working correctly and deploy every site we manage.


## Developing Ghost themes locally

I open sourced [my setup here](https://github.com/firepress-org/ghost-local-dev-in-docker). It’s a workflow to run Ghost locally within a Docker container. Once your local paths are defined, it’s enjoyable and easy to work **between many themes**.


## Well tested

DevOps best practices are essential to us. Many checkpoints ensure this Docker image for Ghost software runs smoothly.

In this post, we explain how we deploy Ghost in production and which best practices we do follow.

https://firepress.org/en/software-and-ghost-updates/


## Random stuff

**Breaking change**. If you still run Ghost 0.11.xx, be aware of the container's path difference.

```
- Ghost 2.x.x is: /var/lib/ghost/content
- Ghost 1.x.x is: /var/lib/ghost/content
- Ghost 0.11.x is: /var/lib/ghost
```

**SQLite Database**

This Docker image for Ghost uses SQLite. There is nothing special to configure.

**What is the Node.js version?**

We follow the latest Node supported version. See this in the Dockerfile.

```
docker exec <container-id> node --version
```

You can also see this information in the Dockerfile and in the Travis builds.


## Services

#### Hosting

**At FirePress we host Ghost’s websites with an optional landing page**. It's fully managed for you. It means you never have to touch a server, do an upgrade, manage backups or any annoying stuff like this.

The idea behind FirePress is to empower freelancers and small organizations to be able to build an outstanding mobile-first website.

Because we believe your website should speak up in your name, we consider our mission completed once your site has become [your impresario](https://firepress.org/en/why-launching-your-next-website-with-firepress/). Start your [free trial here](https://firepress.org/en/10-day-free-trial/). 

#### Workshop

Participants will end up with a website and/or a blog they can smoothly operate themselves. We are actively working on this workshop.

The workshops will be available in those cities:

- Montréal - Canada
- Toronto - Canada
- Québec City - Canada
- New-York - USA
- Boston - USA

Follow the details [on this page](https://firepress.org/en/workshop/).
