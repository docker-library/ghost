## What is this

It‚Äôs a Docker image for running Ghost in a container.

**What is Ghost?** ‚Äî Ghost is an open source software that lets you create your website with a blog. See the [FAQ section](https://play-with-ghost.com/ghost-themes/faq/#what-is-ghost) for more details.


##  Live Demo (online)

Head over to [play-with-ghost.com](https://play-with-ghost.com/) . It‚Äôs is a playground to learn about Ghost. You can see Ghost themes and login into the **admin panel** by using the available credentials. In short, you can try Ghost on the spot without having to sign-up!

And since August 24th 2018, you can try **Ghost version 2** here:<br>
https://play-with-ghost.com/ghost-themes/firepress-vapor-for-barbershops/


## How to use this image

To run Ghost in a Docker container, here is the setup I use in production. Just execute `runup.sh` bash script and you are good to go. This setup also allows you to run your blog under a subdirectory like `mysite.com/blog`.

Ensure you have Docker installed on your server. To update your Ghost container, just stop the container and execute to runup.sh again.

**Option #1** *(prefered)*:
- Run the script: `./runup.sh`

**Option #2**:

```
GHOSTFIRE_IMG="devmtl/ghostfire:1.24.8-583cc3f"

docker run -d \
‚Äîname ghostblog \
-p 2368:2368 \
-e url=http://localhost:2368 -e NODE_ENV=production \
"$GHOSTFIRE_IMG"
```

**Option #3 (Stateful)**

Don‚Äôt forget to change the path on your local drive!

```
GHOSTFIRE_IMG="devmtl/ghostfire:1.24.8-583cc3f"

docker run -d \
‚Äîname ghostblog \
-p 2368:2368 \
-e url=http://localhost:2368 -e NODE_ENV=production \
-v /myuser/local-path/ghost/content:/var/lib/ghost/content \
"$GHOSTFIRE_IMG"
```

### Find the most recent docker image üê≥

Instead of using edge use the **stable image**.

- **Docker hub** ‚Äî https://hub.docker.com/r/devmtl/ghostfire/tags/
- **Travis** ‚Äî https://travis-ci.org/firepress-org/ghostfire

As an example:

### master branch (stable) tags looks like:

```
devmtl/ghostfire:1.24.8-583cc3f-20180713_01H3604
devmtl/ghostfire:1.24.8-583cc3f
devmtl/ghostfire:1.22.8
devmtl/ghostfire:20180713_01H3604
```

I recommend to use the **stable tag**, where:
- `1.24.8-583cc3f-20180713_01H3604` is the **Ghost version** + the **SHA** of the git commit + the **date**.
- The logic is that I can use a **specific** image to test and push it in PROD as needed. In this example, only using `devmtl/ghostfire:1.24.8` could turn out to be a broken docker image and is not the best practice. 


### edge branch tags looks like:

```
devmtl/ghostfire:1.24.8-edge-79fa76a
devmtl/ghostfire:edge
```


### edge vs. master branches

Because I run a lot of websites in production using this image, I prefer to do my tests using a dedicated `edge` branch.

Once I confirm the edge build PASS, I update the Dockerfile under the `master` branch as well. At this point, I‚Äôm reaaaaaally confident the docker image is working correctly.

## Developing Ghost theme, my setup

I open sourced [my setup here](https://github.com/firepress-org/ghost-local-dev-in-docker). It‚Äôs a workflow to run Ghost locally within a Docker container. Once your local paths are define it‚Äôs really fun and easy to work between many themes.


## Various

**Breaking change**

- Ghost 2.x.x is: /var/lib/ghost/content
- Ghost 1.x.x is: /var/lib/ghost/content
- Ghost 0.11.x is: /var/lib/ghost

*If you still run Ghost 0.11.xx, be aware of the container's path difference.*

**SQLite Database**

This Docker image for Ghost uses SQLite. There is nothing special to configure.

**What is the Node.js version?**

```
docker exec <container-id> node --version
```

You can also see this information in the Dockerfile and in the Travis builds.


## Why forking the official Dockerfile?

I tweaked few elements like:

- Ghost container is running under [tini](https://github.com/krallin/tini#why-tini)
- A cleaner ENV VAR management
- Uninstall the `ghost cli` to safe few bytes in the docker image
- In the future, the image will support multi-stage build
