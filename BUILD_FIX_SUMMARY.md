# Ghostfire Build Fix Summary

## Issue Description
The GitHub Actions build was failing with exit code 1 during the Docker build process, specifically in the builder stage when trying to install Ghost and compile native dependencies (sharp and sqlite3 packages).

## Root Cause Analysis
The failure occurred due to several issues:

1. **Package Version Detection**: The script was trying to read `@tryghost/image-transform/package.json` to get the sharp version, but this package structure may have changed in newer Ghost versions.
2. **Ghost CLI Compatibility**: The Ghost CLI version (1.26.1) may not be fully compatible with Ghost 5.102.0.
3. **Missing Build Dependencies**: Some Alpine packages needed for native compilation were missing.
4. **Limited Error Handling**: The build process lacked proper error handling and debugging information.

## Changes Made

### 1. Improved Package Version Detection (`v5/Dockerfile` lines 125-149)
- Added robust error handling with try-catch blocks
- Added fallback logic to detect package versions from multiple sources
- Added debugging output to show detected package versions
- Graceful handling when `@tryghost/image-transform` is not available

### 2. Updated Ghost CLI Version (`v5/Dockerfile` line 19)
- Updated from `1.26.1` to `1.27.0` for better compatibility with Ghost 5.102.0

### 3. Enhanced Build Dependencies (`v5/Dockerfile` line 116)
- Added `pkgconfig` and `libc6-compat` to the build dependencies
- These packages are often required for native module compilation on Alpine Linux

### 4. Improved Package Installation Logic (`v5/Dockerfile` lines 150-169)
- Added npm as a fallback when yarn installation fails
- Enhanced error messages and debugging output
- Better error handling for build-from-source scenarios

### 5. Added Local Testing Script (`v5/test-build.sh`)
- Created a script to test the Docker build locally before pushing to GitHub Actions
- Includes container startup testing and basic functionality verification
- Helps catch issues early in the development process

## Testing Recommendations

### Local Testing
Run the local test script before pushing changes:
```bash
cd v5
./test-build.sh
```

### Manual Docker Build Test
```bash
cd v5
docker build -t ghostfire:test .
docker run -d --name ghosttest -p 2368:2368 -e url=http://localhost:2368 ghostfire:test
```

## Expected Outcomes
These changes should resolve the build failures by:
- Providing more robust package version detection
- Improving compatibility between Ghost CLI and Ghost versions
- Adding necessary build dependencies for Alpine Linux
- Providing better error handling and debugging information
- Offering npm as a fallback installation method

## Files Modified
- `v5/Dockerfile` - Main fixes for build process
- `v5/test-build.sh` - New local testing script (executable)
- `BUILD_FIX_SUMMARY.md` - This documentation

## Next Steps
1. Test the changes locally using the provided test script
2. Commit and push the changes to trigger GitHub Actions
3. Monitor the build process for successful completion
4. If issues persist, the enhanced debugging output will provide better error information
