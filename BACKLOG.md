# BACKLOG (Features)

I'll maintain a backlog here. It's much quicker to [draft these here](https://github.com/firepress-org/ghostfire/blob/master/BACKLOG.md) for the moment.

## 1) GLITCHES

Looks it is FIXED: https://github.com/TryGhost/Ghost/issues/11129#issuecomment-593944437

About issue: https://github.com/docker-library/ghost/issues/198

Workaround: https://github.com/TryGhost/Ghost/issues/11129#issuecomment-588974741

- node_modules/sharp directory
- npm install sharp

Edit: It looks like it did work. However, I had to specify sharp v0.24, e.g. npm install sharp@0.24. The default npm install sharp installed v0.23.4
