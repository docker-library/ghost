## Run ghost with docker

**Option #1**:
- Locally, run the script: `./runup.sh`

**Option #2**:

```
docker run -d \
‚Äîname ghostblog \
-p 2368:2368 \
-e url=http://localhost:2368 -e NODE_ENV=production \
devmtl/ghostfire:1.22.5-f5f0952
```

Make sure to find the most recent docker image build. For the **statefull version**, see the section *Developper setup*.


## Finding what is the most recewnt docker image üê≥

- **Docker hub** ‚Äî https://hub.docker.com/r/devmtl/ghostfire/tags/
- **Travis** ‚Äî https://travis-ci.org/firepress-org/ghostfire

My docker image are tagged as following:

```
# master branch tags examples:
  
devmtl/ghostfire:1.22.5-f5f0952
devmtl/ghostfire:1.22.5
devmtl/ghostfire:20180504_20H18_37

# edge branch tags examples:

devmtl/ghostfire:1.22.5-edge-112f2a2
devmtl/ghostfire:edge

```

I recommand to use the first format, where:
- `1.22.5-f5f0952` is the Ghost Version + the git commit used to do the build

The logic is that I can test a **specific** image in UAT and push it in PROD as needed. In this example, using `devmtl/ghostfire:1.22.4D` could turn out to be a broekn docker image.  


## Developper setup

- Soon, I will share the setup I use on my Mac to develop Ghost Themes and test Ghost in general.


## Why forking the offical Dockerfile ?

The elements I tweaked are:

- Ghost container is running under [tini](https://github.com/krallin/tini)
- Using node:8.11.1-alpine instead of Node:6
- Cleaner ENV management
- Uninstall the `ghost cli` to safe some sapce in the docker image
- Eventually, I will use multi-stage builds


## edge vs master branch

Because I run many-many websites in production, I prefer to do my tests using a dedicated `edge` branch.

Once I confirm the edge build PASS, I update the Dockerfile under the `master` branch as well. At this point, I‚Äôm really confident the docker image is working perfectly.

## Author

In the world of OSS (open source software) most people refer themselves as maintainers. The thing is‚Ä¶ I hate this expression. It feels heavy and not fun. I much prefer author.
