## About Ghost our favorite CMS

Ghost is a free and open source website & blogging platform designed to simplify the process of online publishing for individual bloggers as well as online publications. It‚Äôs a CMS (content management system) designed to be better alternative to  WordPress, Drupal, Medium, Tumblr, etc.


## How to use this image

**Option #1**:
- Locally, run the script: `./runup.sh`

**Option #2**:

```
docker run -d \
‚Äîname ghostblog \
-p 2368:2368 \
-e url=http://localhost:2368 -e NODE_ENV=production \
devmtl/ghostfire:1.22.5-f5f0952
```

**Stateful**

```
docker run -d \
‚Äîname ghostblog \
-p 2368:2368 \
-e url=http://localhost:2368 -e NODE_ENV=production \
-v /path/to/ghost/blog:/var/lib/ghost/content \
devmtl/ghostfire:1.22.5-f5f0952
```

**Breaking change**

If you want to run Ghost 0.11.xx, be aware of the container's path difference:

Ghost 1.x.x is: /var/lib/ghost/content
Ghost 0.11.x is: /var/lib/ghost

**SQLite Database**

This Docker image for Ghost uses SQLite. There is nothing special to configure.

**What is the Node.js version?**

```
docker exec <container-id> node --version
```

- **Travis** ‚Äî https://travis-ci.org/firepress-org/ghostfire

My docker images are tagged as follow:

```
# master branch tags examples:
  
devmtl/ghostfire:1.22.5-f5f0952
devmtl/ghostfire:1.22.5
devmtl/ghostfire:20180504_20H18_37

# edge branch tags examples:

devmtl/ghostfire:1.22.5-edge-112f2a2
devmtl/ghostfire:edge

```

I recommand to use the first tag, where:
- `1.22.5-f5f0952` means the **Ghost Version** + the **SHA of the git commit** used to create the build.
- The logic is that I can use a **specific** test it and push it in PROD as needed. In this example, using `devmtl/ghostfire:1.22.5` could turn out to be a broken docker image.  
- **DO NOT** use the **multistage** tags at this point. It is not stable.

## Developper setup

- Soon, I will share the setup I use on my Mac to develop Ghost Themes and test Ghost in general.


## Why forking the offical Dockerfile ?

The elements I tweaked are:

- Ghost container is running under [tini](https://github.com/krallin/tini)
- Using `node:8.11.1-alpine` instead of Node:6
- Cleaner ENV management
- Uninstall the `ghost cli` to safe some sapce in the docker image
- Eventually, I will use multi-stage builds


## Branches: edge vs master

Because I run a lot of websites in production using this image, I prefer to do my tests using a dedicated `edge` branch.

Once I confirm the edge build PASS, I update the Dockerfile under the `master` branch as well. At this point, I‚Äôm really confident the docker image is working perfectly.

## Author

In the world of OSS (open source software) most people refer themselves as maintainers. The thing is‚Ä¶ I hate this expression. It feels heavy and not fun. I much prefer author.
